An HTML cataloguing system

At the moment, it's about 60 minutes old and is nowhere near ready for use. However, it does take a 5-column source file with the following:

  Title,Pageref,imageref,tags,content
  
And produces HTML files according to the tags laid out in the "source.txt" index.

Work will continue!
